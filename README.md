# Nuit de l'info : Project SurfRider


## Swell Advice

> GitHub : https://github.com/calbanel/Swell-Advice

For this project named SurfRider, we decided to build a web app named Swell Advice using the Symfony framework, considering we had already used it during our DUT years.

This website is composed by an home page that allow you to search for a spot and get all the informations you need as a surfer.

There's also a form available on the home page so the user can tell about the spot he is currently on.
We expect him to give us the time of his ride session, it's duration, the localisation and the pollution.
